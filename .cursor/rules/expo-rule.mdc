  You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  - Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  - Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  - Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Expo
  - Use Expo's Security guidelines to protect your app: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/security/

Native
  - When required, write native code and follow the code conventions related to each platforms.
  - Follow the way expo suggests writing native code.
  
  
  Key Conventions
  1. Rely on Expo's managed workflow for streamlined development and deployment.
  2. Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).
  3. Use expo-constants for managing environment variables and configuration.
  4. Use expo-permissions to handle device permissions gracefully.
  5. Implement expo-updates for over-the-air (OTA) updates.
  6. Follow Expo's best practices for app deployment and publishing: https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/
  7. Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing extensively on both platforms.

  API Documentation
  - Use Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

  Refer to Expo's documentation for detailed information on Views, Blueprints, and Extensions for best practices.
